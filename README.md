üîé Overview

This project focuses on building a machine learning application that detects whether an SMS message is Spam or Ham (Not Spam).
The solution uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) for text preprocessing and multiple ML algorithms for classification.
Additionally, a Streamlit web app is included to provide users with an interactive way to test SMS messages in real time.
